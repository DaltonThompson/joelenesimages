        <h3>A&nbsp;Photographer's Story...</h3>
        <p>As a teenager, I had a dream of starting my own business. My dad would always take photos, and he was always the one behind the lens. I realized that I could do that too, but I needed a camera. I wasn't able to because of finances, and pushed my career away. Then, I found a job in Connecticut working as a traveling photographer. I enjoyed traveling the east coast while learning a craft that brought me great joy.</p>
        <p>I learned making memories for people is my destiny.  I realized why my dad continued to be behind the lens instead of in front of it.  I continue to take photos, get off the traveling side of photography and step into a studio.  I worked under many wonderful managers and was one myself for numerous years.  As I continued in the business, I met my amazing husband of 30 years and had my two sons Dalton and Carson.</p>
        <p>With the closing of Sears Portrait throughout the United States I felt my dream was falling apart. Friends & family gave me support.</p>
        <p>"Joelene, you need to be behind the lens, that is where you are happiest and no matter what is going on in your life that is what makes you who you are."</p>
        <p>That was the day I started Joelene's Images!</p>
